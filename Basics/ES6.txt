ES6
short for ECMAScript

ECMA - controls the standards of the language
	- better versions of the language

JavaScript can also be called ECMAScript


ES6 allows new ways to create symbol names


var symbolName = "value reference in the memory";

let letSymbol = "scoped value"

const symName = "constant value in memory"


let and const - respect the scope within with they are defined.

var - doesn't respect the scope, jumps out of the scope and attaches with 
window obj, so naming symbols conventions can be difficult

var only respects the scope inside a Function/Sub-routine


Use let to respect the scope.

Eg:

for(let i=0; i<5; i++){
}
